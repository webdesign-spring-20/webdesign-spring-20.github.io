					Objects have vanished like smoke; I have destroyed <br>
					the ring of the horizon and got out of the circle of objects:<br>
					this accursed horizon ring that has imprisoned the artist <br>
					and leads him away from the aim of destruction.<br>
					<br>
					The savage was the first to establish the principle of <br>
					naturalism: in drawing a dot and five little sticks, he <br>
					attempted to transmit his own image. This first attempt <br>
					laid the basis for the conscious imitation of nature's forms.<br>
					<br>
					Hence arose the aim of approaching the face of nature as<br>
					closely as possible. The moret his awareness embraced <br>
					nature, the more involved his work became, and the more <br>
					his experience and skill increased.
